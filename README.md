# Clock Exercise

- This is a file for practicing. I am only uisng HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ES6+. 
- For learning purposes, I followed the coding from a WesBos video, on which he shows how to make a clock, with the hour, minute, and second hand going clockwise inside the clock.

- Later, as I was practicing and doing some exercises from `https://www.100jsfunctions.com/exercises`, I created another JavaScript file to run the codes from the exercises, and debug them, to find the answers I was looking for, in an easier and more direct way, plus I could save these exercises, and later look at them, and revise them.
